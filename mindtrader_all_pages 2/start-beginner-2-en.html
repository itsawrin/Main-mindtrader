    <h1>Hashing & Blockchain Security</h1>

    <h2>What is a Hash?</h2>
    <p>
        A hash is a unique code generated from the content of each block. It's like a fingerprint for that blockâ€”no two blocks can have the same hash.
        Even changing one tiny bit of the block will create a completely different hash.
        This makes it nearly impossible to change information in a block without being noticed.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is Blockchain Secure?</h2>
    <p>
        Each block stores its own hash and also the hash of the previous block. This links all the blocks together in a chain.
        If someone tries to change the data in one block, they must also change the hash of that block and all the blocks after it,
        which would require enormous computing power and is almost impossible to do.
