    <h1>Getting Started with Crypto</h1>

    <h2>What is Crypto?</h2>
    <p>
        Cryptocurrency is a type of digital money that is not controlled by any bank or government.
        Transactions are made directly between users without intermediaries like banks.
        This makes it faster, cheaper, and borderless.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
    <p>
        Blockchain is a public and unchangeable digital ledger that records all transactions in a chain-like structure.
        Each transaction is stored inside a “block” along with previous data, and the blocks are connected in sequence.
        This makes the information transparent, secure, and permanent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each block contains details such as timestamp, amount, sender and receiver addresses, and a unique security code called a hash.
        Once verified by the network, the block is added to the chain and cannot be altered.
        This is why blockchain is trusted for storing data in the crypto world.
